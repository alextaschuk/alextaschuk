- [CSV Parser Auxiliary Program](https://github.com/alextaschuk/csv-parser): An auxiliary program that I wrote in Python for [Rate My Lecture](https://github.com/alextaschuk/rate-my-lecture) which parses raw CSV data from a public GitHub repository, then converts and writes the relevant data to two JSON files which correspond to UBC's two campuses.
